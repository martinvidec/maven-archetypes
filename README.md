# Maven Archetypes

This repository contains Maven archetypes for generating cloud-ready web applications with modern development practices and cloud-native principles.

## Overview

This project provides comprehensive technical documentation and specifications for creating production-ready Spring Boot applications using Maven archetypes. The documentation is designed to be implementation-ready, enabling automated code generation tools like Copilot to create complete, working applications.

## Documentation Structure

### 1. Concept Document (`concept.md`)
- High-level overview of cloud-ready web application architecture
- Technology recommendations and trade-offs
- Application aspects covering 11 key areas:
  - Authentication & Authorization
  - Configuration Management
  - Logging & Monitoring
  - Data Persistence
  - API Design & Documentation
  - Resilience & Fault Tolerance
  - Caching
  - Testing Strategy
  - Containerization & Deployment
  - Security
  - Build & CI/CD

### 2. Technical Specifications
Detailed implementation-ready documentation split across multiple files:

#### `technical-specification.md`
- Project overview and target technologies
- Maven archetype structure and metadata
- Complete POM configuration with dependencies
- Project structure and package organization
- Configuration specifications (application.yml, profiles, logging)

#### `technical-specification-part2.md`
- Component specifications (Application class, Configuration classes)
- Domain entities and repository layer
- Service layer with caching and transactions
- Database schema and migration scripts

#### `technical-specification-part3.md`
- Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- REST Controller implementations
- Exception handling and error responses
- Testing framework and integration tests
- Containerization (Docker, Docker Compose)
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Implementation guidelines

## Key Features

The generated applications include:

### Core Technologies
- **Java 17** (LTS)
- **Spring Boot 3.2.0** with Spring Framework 6.1.0
- **Maven 3.9.x** with wrapper support
- **PostgreSQL 15+** with Flyway migrations
- **Redis 7+** for caching and sessions

### Security & Authentication
- Spring Security 6.x with OAuth2/JWT support
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- CORS configuration
- Security headers and HTTPS enforcement

### Monitoring & Observability
- Micrometer metrics with Prometheus integration
- Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- Spring Boot Actuator endpoints
- Health checks and readiness probes

### API Documentation
- OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger) integration
- Interactive API documentation
- Request/response validation

### Testing
- JUnit 5 and Mockito
- TestContainers for integration testing
- Code coverage with JaCoCo
- Security testing support

### Quality & Security
- Code quality plugins (Checkstyle, SpotBugs)
- OWASP dependency vulnerability scanning
- Automated CI/CD pipeline
- Docker containerization

### Performance & Scalability
- Connection pooling (HikariCP)
- Multi-level caching (Caffeine, Redis)
- Resilience patterns (Circuit Breaker, Retry)
- JVM tuning and optimization

## Usage

These specifications are designed for use with automated code generation tools. The documentation provides:

1. **Complete project structure** with exact file layouts
2. **Full source code examples** for all components
3. **Configuration templates** ready for deployment
4. **Build and deployment scripts** for CI/CD
5. **Testing strategies** with concrete examples

## Generated Project Features

Applications generated from these specifications will include:

- ✅ Production-ready Spring Boot application
- ✅ Layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- ✅ RESTful API with comprehensive validation
- ✅ Database integration with migrations
- ✅ Security implementation with JWT
- ✅ Caching and performance optimization
- ✅ Comprehensive testing suite
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Monitoring and observability
- ✅ API documentation
- ✅ Error handling and logging

## Architecture Patterns

The specifications implement several architectural patterns:

- **Layered Architecture**: Controller → Service → Repository → Domain
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific properties and profiles
- **Error Handling**: Global exception handlers with consistent error responses
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication with role-based authorization
- **Caching**: Multi-level caching strategy
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and security testing approaches

## Deployment Support

Generated applications support multiple deployment scenarios:

- **Local Development**: Docker Compose with all dependencies
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes-ready with health checks
- **Cloud Platforms**: Environment variable configuration
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline with security scanning

## Implementation Guidelines

The documentation includes comprehensive implementation guidelines covering:

- Development environment setup
- Configuration management best practices
- Security implementation details
- Performance optimization strategies
- Monitoring and observability setup
- Deployment and operational considerations
